# Increment Xcode Build Number
A Swift script that will increase the build number of all your Xcode projects


### Instructions
1. Put the script where you want it on your Mac. I put mine in my ~/Developer folder.
2. Compile the script in the terminal using swiftc like this: ```swiftc increment_build_number.swift```
3. Add the binary to the Xcode Build Succeded Behavior in the Xcode Preferences (see screenshot below)
